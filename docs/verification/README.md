# Verification evidence

- [October 10 Steam X11 launch integration](2026-10-10-steam-x11.md):
  contributor update, selective preload cleanup, real-wrapper fixtures and
  offline compatibility/package checks; installed-game acceptance remains separate.

- [October 9 Replay save layout and NVIDIA extension discovery](2026-10-09-replay-save-nvidia.md):
  stable duration controls, pending/error status and bounded complete Vulkan
  extension queries; successful NVIDIA encoding still needs hardware acceptance.

- [October 9 temporary tray and live-game window close](2026-10-09-steam-temporary-tray.md):
  revised startup and close policy, compositor-focus regression, current private
  fixtures and production build; installed-game acceptance remains separate.

- [October 9 initial Steam automatic exit](2026-10-09-steam-auto-exit.md):
  historical first implementation and installation, superseded after owner testing.

- [October 9 Replay menu pointer lifecycle](2026-10-09-replay-menu.md): removed
  mouse handles, stale input and view-only polling fixes; local packages built,
  owner-confirmed installed-game menu check on CachyOS.

- [October 8 ultrawide Replay and Intel temperature](2026-10-08-ultrawide.md):
  shared pixel-budget admission, Variable ceilings, package sensor discovery and
  current private-fixture/build evidence; hardware encoding remains unverified.

Add dated reports tied to an exact commit or source-manifest hash. Record commands,
environment, success/failure, excluded scope, and artifact hashes where applicable.
Keep private diagnostics and recordings outside Git and reference them cautiously.
Generated logs live in the ignored `.redunar-build/reports/` directory. A committed
summary should describe the evidence and limitations without dumping private logs.
Historical results in TESTING remain available; new long-form reports belong here.

- [October 8 X11 GLX lookup forwarding](2026-10-08-x11-glx.md): actual-sidecar
  fake-provider repair; reported ARC Raiders cause remains unconfirmed.

- [October 8 native tray task](2026-10-08-native-tray-task.md): direct
  StatusNotifier/DBusMenu client and combined release scope.

- [October 9 native tray and combined candidate](2026-10-09-native-tray.md):
  direct tray lifecycle/protocol tests, local DMS registration and combined checks.
